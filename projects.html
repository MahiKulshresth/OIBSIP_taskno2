            <h2>1. Library Management System</h2>
            <h3>I did this project in my 3rd semester for RDBMS (Relational Database Management System). 
                <br>The database was made in MySQL. All the backend coding was done in Python 3 language 
                <br>using Flask framework. Frontend coding was done in HTML and CSS. The LMS could 
                <br>perform various operations like adding a book, adding a user, calculating dues, 
                <br>generating overdue reports and many more.

            <h2>2. TIC TAC TOE</h2>
            <h3>I did this project in my 3rd semester for OOP (Object Oriented Programming).
                <br> All the coding was done in Python 3. I used Tkinter library in python 
                <br>to generate a simple interface. The game gave both the players (namely X and Y) their
                <br> turns alternatively and at the end declares the winning player (if any), otherwise 
                <br>it displays "It's a draw".

                <h3>I did this project in my 3rd semester for PBL Lab (Project Basrd Learning Lab).
                    <br> All the coding for this machine learning project was done in Python 3.
                    <br>Libraries used were Scikit Learn, Pandas, NumPy and Matplotlib.
                    <br>The Supervised Leaning Technique was used to train the model using a predifined dataset.
                    <br>RandomForest Regressor model was used for training. The whole project was divided into 
                    <br>three modules: Data Preprocessing module, Model Training module and model testing and validation module.
